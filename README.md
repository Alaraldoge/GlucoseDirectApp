# Gluco Direct App

**Warning, the project is strictly for my personal use and is highly experimental.**

This is my playground for the Libre 2 blood glucose sensors, Swift and SwiftUI ([TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dWDt5Wme)).

I try to keep the code as readable and understandable as possible so that as many people as possible can understand how this part of diabetes management works.

## Current features
- Libre 2 EU support, for cgm values (without transmitter)
- Add manual bgm values
- Manage bgm/cgm values
- Units mg/dL or mmol/L
- Nightscout upload
- FreeAPS X support (with Shared App Groups)
- Glucose badge
- Glucose chart
- Glucose trend arrow
- Glucose change per minute
- Factory calibration
- Custom calibration
- Lifetime details
- Sensor details
- Glucose alert for lows and highs
- Connection lost alert
- Missed readings alert
- Sensor expiring alert
- Snooze for glucose alerts

## Roadmap
- refactor to allow different sensors oder transmitters (load md on demand)

## Quick test?
You can quickly get an idea of Libre Direct: [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dWDt5Wme)

## Feedback?
I am very happy to receive feedback - suggestions for improvement or reports of bugs encountered.
