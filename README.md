# Libre Direct

**Warning, in its current state the project is strictly for my personal use and is highly experimental.**

My playground for the Libre 2 blood glucose sensors and Swift/SwiftUI ([TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dWDt5Wme)).

## Current features
- Units mg/dL or mmol/L
- Connection lost alert
- Missed readings alert
- Glucose alert for lows and highs
- Glucose badge
- Glucose chart
- Libre 2 EU support (without transmitter)
- Lifetime visualization
- Sensor details
- Sensor expiring alert
- Snooze for glucose alerts
- Nightscout upload
- FreeAPS X support (with Shared App Groups)
