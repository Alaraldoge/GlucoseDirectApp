# Libre Direct

**Warning, in its current state the project is strictly for my personal use and is highly experimental.**

My playground for the Libre 2 (and maybe other) blood glucose sensors and Swift/SwiftUI.

## Current features
- Connection lost alert
- FreeAPS X Support (with App Groups)
- Glucose alert for lows and highs
- Glucose badge
- Glucose chart
- Libre 2 EU support (without transmitter)
- Lifetime visualization
- Nightscout support
- Sensor details
- Sensor expiring alert
- Snooze for glucose alerts
- Units mg/dL or mmol/L
- Widget (iOS unfortunately throttles the update rate)

## Future
- Feature flags
- Libre 2 US/CA
- Libre 3 (if possible)
